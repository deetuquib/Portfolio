                <h2>Mosasaurus</h2>
                <p>
                    Mosasaurus ( "lizard of the Meuse River") is the type genus (defining example) of the mosasaurs, an extinct group of aquatic squamate reptiles. The skull of Mosasaurus was equipped with robust jaws capable of swinging back and forth and strong muscles capable of powerful bites using dozens of large teeth designed for cutting prey. Its four limbs were shaped into robust paddles to steer the animal underwater. Its tail was long and ended in a downward bend and a paddle-like fluke. Mosasaurus was a predator possessing excellent vision to compensate for its poor sense of smell. Mosasaurus was a common large predator in these oceans and was positioned at the top of the food chain.

                    Were some of the largest land animals known to have ever existed. The largest ones weighed as much as 76 tons. Many titanosaurs were armored with a small mosaic of small, bead-like scales surrounding larger scales. Their diet consisted of a wide variety of plants and grasses. These terrestrial titans traveled in herds and exhibited a pack behaviour that offered defenses against other predators.

                <p>
                    Quetzalcoatlus is a pterosaur known from the Late Cretaceous period of North America (Maastrichtian stage); it was one of the largest known flying animals of all time. These exceptional creatures boasted wingspans as large as 55 feet across, lifting the proposed 1,100lb creature into the skies. A terrifying sight to behold. These terrestrial stalkers, similar to modern storks, probably hunted small vertebrates on land or in small streams.

                <p>
                    The species Tyrannosaurus rex (rex meaning "king" in Latin). Tyrannosaurus was a bipedal carnivore with a massive skull balanced by a long, heavy tail. Relative to its large and powerful hind limbs, the forelimbs of Tyrannosaurus were short but unusually powerful for their size, and they had two clawed digits. T-rex is among the largest known land predators and is estimated to have exerted the strongest bite force among all terrestrial animals. By far the largest carnivore in its environment, Tyrannosaurus rex was most likely an apex predator
