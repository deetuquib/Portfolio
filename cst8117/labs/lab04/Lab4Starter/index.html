                Our daycare center now features a cat porch so that your cat can enjoy fresh air while 
                we ensure their safety. Our reinforced safety screens keep your cat safe from outdoor 
                dangers while allowing your cat to watch and dream about catching the squirrels and 
                birds that visit daily. Your cat will love our new cat porch.
